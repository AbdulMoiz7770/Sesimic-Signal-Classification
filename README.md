Overview:

This repository contains a self-collected seismic dataset used for classifying ground vibration signals generated by Vehicles, Bikes, and Persons. The dataset is intended for research and experimentation in seismic signal processing and machine learning–based classification.

Dataset Description:

The dataset consists of three CSV files:

Vehicle.csv – Seismic signals generated by vehicle movement

Bike.csv – Seismic signals generated by bike movement

Person.csv – Seismic signals generated by human walking activity

Each file contains approximately 1,500 instances, making the dataset balanced across all three classes.

Data Structure:

Each CSV file contains 1024 columns

Each row represents one seismic signal instance

Each column corresponds to a sample point collected over time for that instance

This structure allows direct use of raw seismic signals for time-series analysis, feature extraction, or transformation into frequency-domain representations.

Data Collection Details:

Sensor Used: Geophone

Geophone Frequency: 10 Hz

ADC Sampling Rate: 1 kHz

Data Source: Self-collected under controlled conditions

Ground vibration signals were recorded using the geophone and digitized via the ADC for further processing and analysis.

Intended Use

This dataset can be used for:

Seismic signal classification

Time-series and frequency-domain signal analysis

Feature extraction for ML/DL models

Training and evaluation of classifiers for activity/object detection

File Format:

All files are provided in CSV format

Compatible with Python, MATLAB, and other data analysis tools

Notes:

The dataset is self-collected and may include real-world noise.

Users should apply appropriate preprocessing, filtering, and normalization as required.
